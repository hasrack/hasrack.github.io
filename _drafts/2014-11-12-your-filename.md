# **Living with Chrome OS**


----------
When Google first revealed Chrome OS, an operating system based on Linux kernel and will utilize cloud for user data and applications back in  2009 most of the tech industry was astonished by this bold move from Google. You need internet in the first place  to log in to the OS and then use it. It was crazy for them. However things have been changing slowly but steadily.  

I am  enthusiastic about new OS/technology or device and like to tinker with them. Chrome OS caught my eye when it was first announced. I  hesitated because of the always online requirement . But gradually chrome OS gained some offline capabilities through packaged apps and offline support for Google Drive. And Now I am here  writing my experiences with this OS.


# _Getting Chrome O_S



You can't load or install Chrome OS on your own device. You need to get Google certified device manufactured by various OEMs like HP, Dell, Acer etc. So it's a turn key solution just like Mac hardware . You have got 3 options to choose.

 - Chromebook
 - Chromebox
 - Chromebase

There are quite a few models of  chromebooks you can find in [amazon](http://goo.gl/IlIurZ). I  got the white version [HP chromebox](http://goo.gl/gvBvu5). Here are the specs.


| Specifications        |            | 
| -------------  |:-------------:
| Processor      | Intel Celeron 2955u 1.4 Ghz | 
| RAM            | 2 GB DDR3L 1.35v (user up-gradable) |   
| Storage        | 16 GB SSD (user up-gradable)  | 
| Wifi and Bluetooth | a/b/g/n and  4.0

I can't hear the fan(at least where I use it) and more than adequate for chrome OS. Only problem is that it comes with 2 GB RAM. This post is more about chrome OS. I will write about it in another post. 

# _Running for the first time_


----------

You may assume that I just unbox  the device, plug it in and voila! Nope I had to wait a for day to even turn this device on for two reasons

 - [Nation-wide blackout](http://bdnews24.com/bangladesh/2014/11/01/bangladesh-goes-dark-as-power-outage-continues)
 - No converter for US pin

Anyway, I managed all those and boot up the device following day. It greeted me with a chrome logo and after setting up the internet it began downloading the latest updates. 
 
 ![setup step](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/u-As0LkGdJhVsHhPzSI44psrPmxngvnyGPf-IUALG6uwm7oW2pDDiOWj4-B2JSOleCcvfw=w1327-h513 "first-setup.jpg")

It took about an hour ( My net connection is slow) to finish and after a reboot the login screen appeared. The boot time is crazy fast. It takes more time to write my password :P.

After the log in my account was syncing as usual. It took another 30-45 minutes to sync. 

# _Inside the Chrome OS Desktop_


----------
First of all here is a photo of the desktop.

![enter image description here](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/PMbyixirW81qJyehixMy1Qu4UVYRtVf-GvVk9YlQtI3vwLy-rhHm5Ux5Y_qNky5i0tu3-A=w1327-h513 "desktop.jpg")

It is clean and without any fuzz. I personally like it.  It looks similar to windows and KDE 4 desktop but without all bells and whistles of the latter two. If you are familiar with those desktops, then you are in home. There are also expose and window snapping feature. 


# _Going Offline_


------------
After the initial setup and sync I tried to see if I could log in offline. Ha ha! Yes, It does work. You can get various offline app at chrome webstore to accomplish your task. Let's see what can you in offline by default in chrome OS.

 - Run some android app

Yes you can run android apps on chrome OS.  As of writing  officially 11 android apps are supported on chrome OS. But unofficially it is much bigger
