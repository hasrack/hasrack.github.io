title: Living With Chrome OS
---

When Google first revealed Chrome OS, an operating system based on Linux kernel and will utilize cloud for user data and applications back in  2009 most of the tech industry was intrigued  by this bold move from Google. You need internet in the first place  to log in to the OS and then use it. It was crazy for them.

I am  enthusiastic about new OS/technology or device and like to tinker with them. Chrome OS caught my eye when it was first announced. I  hesitated because of the always online requirement . But gradually chrome OS gained some offline capabilities through packaged apps and offline support for Google Drive. And Now I am here  writing my experiences with this OS.


# _Getting Chrome OS_



You can't load or install Chrome OS on your own device. You need to get Google certified device manufactured by various OEMs like HP, Dell, Acer etc. So it's a turn key solution just like Mac hardware . You have got 3 options to choose.

 - Chromebook
 - Chromebox
 - Chromebase

There are quite a few models of  chromebooks you can find in [amazon](http://goo.gl/IlIurZ). I  got the white version [HP chromebox](http://goo.gl/gvBvu5). Here are the specs.


| Specifications        |            | 
| -------------  |:-------------:
| Processor      | Intel Celeron 2955u 1.4 Ghz | 
| RAM            | 2 GB DDR3L 1.35v (user up-gradable) |   
| Storage        | 16 GB SSD (user up-gradable)  | 
| Wifi and Bluetooth | a/b/g/n and  4.0

I can't hear the fan(at least where I use it) and more than adequate for chrome OS. Only problem is that it comes with 2 GB RAM. This post is more about chrome OS. I will write about it in another post. 

# _Running for the first time_



You may assume that I just unbox  the device, plug it in and voila! Nope I had to wait a for day to even turn this device on for two reasons

 - [Nation-wide blackout](http://bdnews24.com/bangladesh/2014/11/01/bangladesh-goes-dark-as-power-outage-continues)
 - No converter for US pin

Anyway, I managed all those and boot up the device following day. It greeted me with a chrome logo and after setting up the internet it began downloading the latest updates. 
 
 ![setup step](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/u-As0LkGdJhVsHhPzSI44psrPmxngvnyGPf-IUALG6uwm7oW2pDDiOWj4-B2JSOleCcvfw=w1327-h513 "first-setup.jpg")

It took about an hour ( My net connection is slow) to finish and after a reboot the login screen appeared. The boot time is crazy fast. It takes more time to write my password :P. 


![enter image description here](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/v62vBRhhZUgpuXB5eC2d-rLMgpFF6dAMqiEWAC3kcerhMBUG4coy5HyZVz8bNfiDL6QM2Q=w1327-h513 "sign in screen.jpg")

After the log in my account was syncing as usual. It took another 30-45 minutes to sync. 

# _Inside the Chrome OS Desktop_


First of all here is a photo of the desktop.

![enter image description here](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/PMbyixirW81qJyehixMy1Qu4UVYRtVf-GvVk9YlQtI3vwLy-rhHm5Ux5Y_qNky5i0tu3-A=w1327-h513 "desktop.jpg")

It is clean and without any fuzz. I personally like it.  It looks similar to windows and KDE 4 desktop but without all bells and whistles of the latter two. There is a launcher, taskbar , notofication center , time and user's profile picture. When you click on the picture you will get some options like settings, network, language etc. Chrome OS uses "Ash" window manager. It's very simple and  doesn't have many options.  There are also expose and window snapping feature. 


# _Going Offline_

After the initial setup and sync I tried to see if I could log in offline. Ha ha! Yes, It does work. You can get various offline app at chrome webstore to accomplish your task. Let's see what can you do in offline  in chrome OS.

 - Play audio, video from internal or external storage 
     -  [Subtitle video player](http://goo.gl/HwauLE) and [Enjoy Music player](http://goo.gl/XKXJHy) are good 3rd party option
 - Basic image editing
	 - [Polarr](http://goo.gl/SHnDOU) and [Pixlr Touch-up](http://goo.gl/tysFCd)  
 - Offline support for Google Drive. So you can edit your documents while offline
 -  Text editing/ light programming/markdown editor 
	- [Caret](http://goo.gl/OyMKUZ), [Subtext](http://goo.gl/cCNYrH), [Zen](http://goo.gl/LhXabj)
 - Writing blog post like myself 
 - Play games
    - [Tank Rider](http://goo.gl/jFE8kv), [Save the Day](http://goo.gl/OrFmwX), [Cracking Sands Racing](http://goo.gl/tYXRCq), [Bastion](http://goo.gl/6ZEiFI) 
 - Drawing diagrams,flow chart or mind mapping  
 - Run some android app

Yes you can run android apps on chrome OS. More onto later. 


# _Running Android Apps_

I was thrilled when  Google announced support for android apps in chrome OS back at i/o 2014. Another reason to try out chrome OS for me. I tried first with officials one. When you install your android app for chrome OS, it will download android runtime for chrome  behind the scene.  I installed podcast addict. It is a podcast manager available for android. It installed in a tablet mode.

![Android  app on chrome.jpg](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/omrBTh-DYCwNocKC8tUKup6r1trExVBz8DVdk9h8Y5pF_d4uQUBc-i6ZtK-IehD7gr1AyQ=w1327-h513 "Android  app on chrome.jpg")

As you can see the maximize button is missing on the window manager and looks little blurry . So it's not a very  optimum experience. There was another problem. I can't access any downloaded episode outside the app.

There are only 11 officially supported apps such as vine, evernote, podcast adict, Dulingo etc. But you can run quite a few android apps in chrome OS by turning apk into chrome extension. The result is mixed bag. I successfully installed and use Ranchrush 2 lite and World of Goo (Demo) games from Play Store. 

![Running unofficial android app](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/_AnJwODs9Ahb40cZzO0gzNP11wQ-7PmrU6Q7wLtvUgvbP1m1f0YV0UPoZYoCI1oHYdWZeg=w1327-h513 "ranchrush 2.jpg")

Skype works with text chat but crashed with audio. Adobe reader and WPS Office crashed while opening PDF and documents.  There is a [list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1iIbxaftAu_ho5rv9fUlXSLTzwU6MbKOldsWXyrYiyo8/edit#gid=0) of android apps that can be run on chrome OS. It's unofficial so try it on your own risk.



# _Online Mode_

Chrome OS trully shines when you are online. It was built for this purpose. Open your device, log in and go to web. It is specially good for collaboration work like google docs, coding. You can use koding, shiftedit, nitrous.io for collaborative coding. It's also good for bloggers who do their blogging entirely on browser. Well I am using an offline markdown editor to write this post and push it later to my site. You can edit your photos online using [Pixlr.com](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/pixlr-editor/icmaknaampgiegkcjlimdiidlhopknpk?utm_source=chrome-app-launcher-info-dialog) and Photoshop will also be available for chrome OS in near future through virtualization.  You can also use torrent client. Good enough for web developer and content writer.

But chrome OS is not for everyone. It also has it's pros and cons.

Here my list of pros and cons.

# _Pros_

 - Simple, less learning curve
 - Very fast to boot, wake from sleep mode and shutdown
 - Uses less resource  and generally feels fast even with lower end cpu
 -  Less chances of virus because of the OS design and security
 -  Everything is synced up with your account. So even if you lost or damage your device your apps and settings will be safe. 
 -  Less maintenance needed. So relief for IT department and or family IT guy.

# _Cons_

 -  Some people will find chrome OS limiting
 - No SMB/NFS support by default
 - If you don't have google cloud supported printer, then it's a hassle to print 
 -  No git client
 - Lack of decent offline audio/video converter
 - Personally I don't like chrome's download manager
 -  Need  more decent offline capable app (My personal wish)
 - No usb DVD/Blu-ray support 
 -  People with limited data may have problem

# _Final Thoughts_

Chrome OS is not for everybody. If you are dependent on specific suite or software(adobe suite) on other platform then you should stick to that. If you spend most of the time in  browser(specifically chrome), then it will be similar experience. You can get by chrome OS's limitation by installing traditional Linux distributions and run it side by side with chrome OS. But that's another story. It is a good option as a secondary device for doing some light work, watching movie and browsing web. Use your desktop or main PC for more heavier task or use remote desktop from chrome OS.
