I am a fun loving guy. Always try to keep smiling and try to help my friend and make them smile. A simple pure smile is priceless to me. I like to tinker with new device or technology and love open-source. I am an on and off type gamer and generally prefer indie titles over big name AAA developers. I find indie scene full of fresh ideas and talent.
